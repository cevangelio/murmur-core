### Performance Drivers  

The day opened with a broad JPY rally that pushed USD_JPY and CAD_JPY sharply lower, dragging the basket to its deepest loss by midnight. However, the tide turned dramatically into the Asian afternoon as AUD and GBP crosses staged a strong comeback. GBP_AUD and EUR_AUD shorts delivered over 600 pips each at peak, while AUD_JPY soared more than 340 pips from entry. 

By mid-afternoon, momentum carried the entire basket into positive territory, led by risk-on sentiment and unwinding of JPY longs. Even USD_JPY joined the rally briefly, contributing to the midday high. 

The U.S. CPI release late in the evening revealed sharply lower inflation figures across the board. This dovish surprise triggered a rapid weakening of the USD and further supported risk currencies like AUD, driving continued gains in AUD_JPY and GBP_AUD. CAD_JPY also extended higher despite some retracement in the JPY pairs later in the session.

### Trading Takeaway  
Patience pays when macro catalysts align with positioning. Sharp reversals offer opportunitiesâ€”if risk is managed to survive the storm.

### Macro Correlation Summary  
- **FOMC Minutes (2025-04-10T02:00):** High-impact release but had limited immediate effect on the basket as most pairs were still recovering from the JPY shock.
- **U.S. CPI Releases (2025-04-10T20:30 GMT+8):**  
  - *Inflation Rate MoM:* Forecast 0.1%, Actual **-0.1%**  
  - *Inflation Rate YoY:* Forecast 2.6%, Actual **2.4%**  
  - *Core Inflation YoY:* Forecast 3.0%, Actual **2.8%**  
  - *CPI s.a:* Forecast 320.1, Actual **319.615**  
  - These across-the-board softer-than-expected figures triggered USD selling and risk appetite, enhancing gains in AUD and CAD trades, and reducing pressure on GBP.

**TL;DR:**  
A volatile day that opened with pain but ended in triumph. Early JPY strength punished longs, but a global macro shift post-CPI launched a powerful reversal. Trade size is nothing without survivability.
