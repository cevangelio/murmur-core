# **JPY Reversal, Sterling Surge: April 11 Trade Recap**

---

### Highest Basket PnL  
- **+813.4 pips**  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-04-11T03:30  
*Strong rallies in GBP_AUD and EUR_AUD during the Asian session lifted the entire basket to its peak.*

### Lowest Basket PnL  
- **-506.5 pips**  
- **Timestamp:** 2025-04-11T16:45  
*A broad-based JPY reversal and weakness in EUR pairs dragged down performance sharply late afternoon.*

### Performance Drivers  
The day kicked off with a powerful move in GBP_AUD and EUR_AUD, likely fueled by risk-on sentiment and early European flows. JPY crosses initially showed strength, especially AUD_JPY, which surged over +180 pips by late US session. However, USD_JPY and CHF_JPY suffered severe losses throughout the day, erasing earlier gains.  

GBP pairs outperformed across the boardâ€”GBP_AUD alone consistently printed +400 pips swings, peaking near +522.7 pips. Meanwhile, EUR_GBP sank steadily as the euro weakened against both the pound and the Aussie.  

The turning point came post-Asia into early Europe as risk appetite soured and macro news began shifting sentiment.

### Trading Takeaway  
Big winners donâ€™t mean the risk has left the roomâ€”respect reversals, especially with JPY pairs. Macro events may not always spark the move, but they often slam the brakes.

### Macro Correlation Summary  
- **United Kingdom GDP MoM (14:00 SGT):**  
  - Forecast: 0.1%, Actual: 0.5%  
  - GBP strength surged post-release, boosting GBP_AUD and dragging EUR_GBP lower.

- **United States PPI MoM (20:30 SGT):**  
  - Forecast: 0.2%, Actual: -0.4%  
  - Weak inflation reading weighed on USD across the board; USD_JPY dropped an additional ~40 pips after.

- **US Michigan Consumer Sentiment (22:00 SGT):**  
  - Forecast: 54.5, Actual: 50.8  
  - Further weakened USD into the late US session, confirming soft sentiment and sustaining downward pressure.

**TL;DR:**  
Sterling strength and soft US inflation drove early gains, but late-day JPY buying reversed much of the profit. Volatility reminded us that even the best setups can fade fastâ€”stay nimble.
